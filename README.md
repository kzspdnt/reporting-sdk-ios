# Euvic Mobile SDK iOS

## Installation

The library is available via Cocapods or Swift Package Manager. You can also add the binary file to a project on your own. 

### Cocoapods

Add dependency to your Podfile\
`pod EuvicMobileSDK`

### Swift Package Manager
Once you have your Swift package set up, adding EuvicMobileSDK as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the dependencies value of your Package.swift.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/Clickonometrics/reporting-sdk-ios.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "0.2.0"))
]
```

## Configuration

Before sending events configuration is required. We recommend to do it just after starting the app, because all events submitted earlier will not be sent.
Simply add the following code to your AppDelegate.swift

```swift
import EuvicMobileSDK

@UIApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {
    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
        EuvicMobile.shared.configure(url: "https://your-event-tracker.com", apiKey: "your-api-key")
        ...
    }
```

### Ad Identifier Tracking
To use system ad identifier request tracking authorization is needed. Simply add:

```swift
ATTrackingManager.requestTrackingAuthorization { _ in }
```
along with `NSUserTrackingUsageDescription` in your Info.plist file before sending first event.

### Location Tracking
To allow library to track user's location you need to request about location permission in your app before sending an event using:

```swift
CLLocationManager().requestWhenInUseAuthorization()
```
Remember to add also description in Info.plist file under `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription`.
